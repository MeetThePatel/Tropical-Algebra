# Tropical Algebra

This package is an implementation of the tropical algebra in Rust.

[Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tropical_algebra)

**Warning**: This package is in very early stages of development. Many features have not been implemented yet.

## Planned Features:

- [X] Implement the basic elements of the ring, and their associated operations.
- [ ] Convert implementation to generics (to generalize from `f64` to any numeric type).
- [ ] Add support for matrices (using tropical matrix addition and matrix multiplication).
